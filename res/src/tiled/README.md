# Editing Zabuyaki with Tiled #
Download Tiled [Tiled Map Editor](http://www.mapeditor.org) or [GitHub](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled)
Version 1.2.5

## Stages naming ##
Default stage name template: **stageX_map.tmx**

## Map size ##
Set and update the map size. It is used to set "walls" around the area.
Use menu **Map / Map Properties**/ to see the list of properties.
Use tiles width and height as a grid. The final map size is calculated from tiles size and the map size in tiles. 

## Export stages to Zabuyaki ##
Use menu **File / Export as...** **stageX_map.lua** to _\src\def\stage\_ .
Where N is the stage number.

## Creating a new file ##
Press **Ctrl + N**. Set the _orientation_ to **Orthogonal**. _Layer format_ to **CSV** and _Tile order_ to **Left Up**.

Zabuyaki uses no tile layers. But you can set the _tile size_ to use it as a grid for aligning images and objects.

Then press **Ok**. Now you should delete default **Tile Layer**.

## Collision objects (walls) ##
Go to the layers tab. Create **Object layer**. Rename it to "collision".
Only the first "collision" layer will be used. All the rest object layers named "collision" will be ignored. 

Now you can add collision objects into the game. The collision objects names are optional.

To select / edit certain objects go to the **Objects** tab (at the right) and expand 
the collision layer list.

> Hint: Use menu **View / Object Types Editor** to set the colour of the walls (e.g. blue).

> Hint: To pixel-wise positioning use the property window at the left. You can use up/down arrows near the coordinates properties 

## Invisible platforms ##
Add a wall as described in the collision objects. To transform the wall into a platform add custom property:
* height <- set the platform height. 

## Vertical Camera Positioning ##
Go to the layers tab. Create **Object layer**. Rename it to "camera".
Only the first "camera" object layer and the 1st polyline object will be used.

Select "Polyline" drawing tool and draw the line with some segments.
This polyline sets the bottom of the center of the camera view window (320x240 pixels).
The polyline should be longer than the width of the stage.

Horizontal parts of the polyline fix vertical camera position. Descending and ascending parts make
the camera follow the path.

> Hint: Use menu **View / Object Types Editor** to set the colour of the camera object (e.g. red).

> Hint: Hold SPACE key while drawing with the left mouse button pressed to pan the stage.

## Background and foreground image layers ##
All the background parallax images go into **background** Group Layer.
All the foreground images should be placed into **foreground** Group Layer.
Name it either **background** or **foreground**. The case matters!

To add new images onto the stage select the Group Layer and go to the **Layers tab**.
Create **Image Layer**. Select a new image file for the Image property.
Rename the Image Layer as just added image! 

You can add sub-folders with images withing **background** or **foreground**.
Only **Group Layer** type of the sub-folders is supported. Please avoid adding more sub-folders within sub-folders. 

Set property **Visible** to false if you don't want to see this image or the sub-folder in the game. You can toggle it later.

E.g. Use a big stage picture as a template. You can vary its transparency level.
It is good for positioning. But this property value is ignored in Zabuyaki.

> Hint: You can duplicate layers. They would keep its properties and the image reference. Just move it and rename.

> Hint: Change the images and sub-folders order to affect the in game Z-Index. 

> Hint: Use LOCK icons to protect images or groups of images from shifting.

## Adding animation to image layers ##
You can use single framed pictures as placeholders for the animations.
The animated image should have different file name and kept in the same folder as its placeholder.
The animated image should consist of a row of the animation frames.
Each frame should be exactly the same size as the placeholder.
If the animation has transparent pixels do not forget to leave 1-pixel wide transparent borders in each frame.
The transparent borders is the part of the placeholder image and all animated frames.    
The placeholder needs 'animate' custom property.
Custom Properties:
* **animate** animatedImageFileName frameN delay frameN delay frameN delay ... <- Image name should have no spaces and extension. '.png' extension and the path are automatically added.    
> Hint: You can have any number of the animated frames in the sequence: _"animatedLamp 1 0.5 2 0.5 3 0.5 2 0.25"_

> Hint: A group of ImageLayers could have the same custom property which could be inherited or replaced by the ImageLayers individually. 

## Background and foreground parallax ##
Every Image Layer (single image) or a Group Layer (starting from the root folders **background** and **foregroung**) may have these attributes:
* **relativeX** (float) - alters the scrolling speed relatively to the horizontal player's movement.
Use values 0 .. 1 to slow down the background layers. Use 0 to make them stop moving (e.g. Moon). Use negative values for **foreground** layer.
* **relativeY** (float) - the same behavior as relativeX attribute but for vertical movement.
* **scrollSpeedX** (float) - speed that moves the image in the horizontal loop. You may use negative value to move the image backwards. 
* **scrollSpeedY** (float) - speed that moves the image in the vertical loop. 
  
## Background image file format ##
Supported image formats: **PNG, JPEG, TGA,** and **BMP**.

Use PNG 8-bit with indexed transparency. Leave 2 transparent pixels at every side of the image. They are cropped automatically. 

## Stage default background color ##
Use menu **Map / Map Properties** to see the **Background color** map property. 
Expand the property and edit R G B and Alpha(transparency) entries.

## Select weather on the stage floor
Use menu **Map / Map Properties**.
Add into **Custom Properties** string value **weather**. List of supported values: "rain".

## Enable reflections on the stage floor
Use menu **Map / Map Properties**.
Add into **Custom Properties** bool value **enableReflections**.

## Adjust reflections height
Use menu **Map / Map Properties**. Add into **Custom Properties** float value **reflectionsHeight**. The value alters the reflections height. Use values from 0.1 to 1. Default value is 1.
This value is applicable to the units reflections only.

## Set reflections opacity
Use menu **Map / Map Properties**. Add into **Custom Properties** float value **reflectionsOpacity**. Use value from 0 to 1. Default value is 0.2 ( from GLOBAL_SETTINGS.REFLECTIONS_OPACITY ) is used on omitting the property.
This value is applicable to the units reflections only.

## Adding background images as reflections ##
The _hardcoded_ reflections of the background images have custom property **reflect**. Set it to the _boolean_ type with _true_ value.    

> Hint: A group of ImageLayers could have the same reflection property which could be inherited or replaced by the ImageLayers individually. It is a good idea to greate a group folder '**my hardcoded reflections**' (the folder name does not matter) with **reflect _true_** property inside of the **background** layers group. So a single property will be applied to all images in the group.

> Hint: The images with reflection property keep their order on drawing. Their order does not interfere with the the normal images order. 

> Hint: The foreground layer images with reflection property will not be drawn. Do not use this property for the foreground images.   
 
## Optional stage characters' shadows height and angle ##
Use menu **Map / Map Properties** to see the **Background color** map property. 
Add **shadowHeight** and **shadowAngle** float properties into **Custom Properties**.  

> Defaults: shadowAngle 0.2, shadowHeight 0.3.

Recommended scoop: shadowAngle Range -1 .. 1, shadowHeight 0.2 .. 1.


## Define events ##
All the events should be created in "global" **Object group**. Every event should have type "event". The events can be activated and used once. 
There are 3 allowed event shapes: **Rectangle**, **Ellipse** and **Point**.
> **Rectangle** and **Ellipse** events activate on collision with a player. **Point** shaped event can be called by name only.
> **Polygon** shape is not supported. 

Custom Properties:
* **go** (Point name) <- move player(s) to the map point. 
* **gox** ( X ) <- move player(s) by X pixels. Use negative number to move players left. Yo cannot use both '**go**' and '**gox**' in the same event.
* **goy** ( Y ) <- move player(s) by Y pixels. Use negative number to move players up. You can use both '**goy**' and '**gox**' in the same event to move players diagonally.
* **togox** ( X ) & **togoy** ( Y ) <- The same as **gox**/**goy**, but players are instantly teleported to the x+togox, y+togoy point and return to their original position. It is used in the enter map events.
* **duration** seconds <- duration of the movement. 1 second if missing.
* **face** ( 1 / -1 ) <- Face player(s)'s face to the set direction. If missing the facing is set automatically.
* **move** ("player"/"players") <- Whom to move either the 1st collided player or all the alive players. On missing the property "players" type is used. 
* **ignorestate** <- Apply the movement to players despite on their current states. (This property is ignored now). 
* **disabled** <- Disable event. It cannot be run. It is used for empty events that work as targets for '**go**' events.
* **notouch** <- This event can be called by the name only. 
* **animation** (animation name) <- Set sprite animation before the movement. On missing the property "walk" animation is used.
* **z** (positive number) <- Set final player(s) z coordinate. Can be used to emulate flying / climbing / falling.  
* **nextevent** (event name) <- start this event next (it is called as if it was collided with a player). Such chained events might be located out of the walkable area. Also you can call predefined events.
* **nextmap** (map name) <- Override map property 'nextmap' with (map name). It can be used for forking to a secret map.

We will add other rectangle event triggers of other types in this group later.
> Hint: To make players stop moving and **wait for 3.5 seconds** create an event and add properties: **gox 0** and **duration 3,5**.

## Predefined events ##
* **nextmap** <- Load next map. The next map is set in the map properties. Override it with an event's 'nextmap' (map name) property.   

## Define enemy waves ##
Go to the layers tab. Create **Group layer**. Rename it to "waves".
Now add one or more **Object layers** of the **wave** type into the **Group layer** "waves".
 
Every added wave **Object layer** should be named. Give simple names to your waves, such as '1' '2' '3' '4' etc.
You can alter its _Transparency_ or _Color_ properties to alter color of their units on the Tiled screen.

To define the wave area width add a rectangle object into the **Group layer** "waves" to set the wave area. The object type should be "wave". 
> Hint: The height of the wave shape is ignored.

The x coordinate of the left and the right sides of the wave are used as the horizontal positions of the players stoppers.

Custom properties for each **Object layer** wave:
* **maxActiveEnemies** <- enemies count should be active on the screen at the time. Default value: 5.
* **aliveEnemiesToAdvance** <- alive enemies count to be able to end current wave and go to the next wave. Default value: 0. The final wave should have value 0 or else the walking alive enemies might break the ending events in the stage.
* **music** <- start playing a new BGM by alias. All the music aliases are defined in 'preload_bgm.lua'. This property is optional.
* **onStart** (event name) <- call event at the wave init (before its enemy spawn because the whole spawn can be delayed and an every enemy spawn can be delayed, too).
* **onEnter** (event name) <- call event on the last player crossing the left bound of the wave.
* **onLeave** (event name) <- call event on the last player crossing the right bound of the wave.
* **onComplete** (event name) <- call event (name) on the last wave enemy death. 

> Hint: Every wave event should be defined as a global event somewhere at the stage. Keep it away from the walking areas to prevent starting on a player collision.  

## Add enemy units to a wave ##
Go to the layers tab. Select any **Object layer** within "waves" **Group layer**. 

Now you can add enemy units or stage objects into the game.
Every unit should have these properties
* **Name** <- enemy's name
* **Type** <- sign, trashcan, gopper, niko, sveta, zeena, beatnik or satoff

Enemy unit's x,y coords equal to coords of the shape center. Only "Point" shape is supported.

> Hint: You can setup Tiled to show different types of the objects with different colours. 
) Use menu **View / Object Types Editor** to set the colours. These settings are kept locally in Tiled cache.

## Optional units properties ##
Optional properties:
* **appearFrom** <- override default x coordinate. Supported values: "left", "right", "jump", "leftJump", "rightJump". The unit will appear either at the left or right screen edges.
**left** and **right** make units walk in the stage from the certain screen edges. 
**jump** is for a vertical jump on place. **leftJump** and **rightJump** make units jump in the stage from the certain screen edges. You can alter initial **z** coordinate with a property.
**fall** (**fallDamage**) <- spawn a falling (falling with damage) unit. You can alter initial **z** coordinate with a property. Use properties **flip** and **speed_x**, **speed_y**, **speed_z** to alter facing and the direction of the fall.
* **hp** <- override default hp
* **lives** <- override default number of lives (default = 1)
* **spawnDelay** <- delay before unit's appearance in seconds (float numbers are fine, too)
* **waitCamera** <- hold unit spawning until it is in the camera view (on the players screen)
* **z** <- initial z coordinate (e.g. to jump off heights)
* **state** <- units state on spawn: intro (If set then the animation is set to 'intro' else the stand state is used).
* **speed_x** **speed_y** **speed_z** <- override default speed of spawned units (it is used in jumps and falls).
* **animation** <- any sprite animation name that should override defaults.
* **target** <- select a player to attack first ("close", "far", "weak", "healthy", "slow" or "fast").
* **palette** <- select unit's coloring number (shaders). 1 - default.
* **wakeRange** <- distance in pixels to the closest player to wake from the 'intro' state (100px by default).  
* **delayedWakeRange** <- the 2nd distance in pixels to the closest player to wake from the 'intro' state (150px by default).
* **wakeDelay** <- unit starts acting if the delay is over and a player is within 'delayedWakeRange'.
* **flip** <- flip default unit's facing  
* **drop** <- which loot to drop. It can be one **apple**, **chicken** or **beef**

## Define global units ## 
A unit without **wave** is called global. It is spawned on the stage loading.
They are added into the root **Object layers** named "global".

Every unit should contain these properties
* **Name** <- enemy's name
* **Type** <- sign, trashcan, gopper, niko, sveta, zeena, beatnik or satoff
> Hint: These units do not lock you within a wave area. You can spare their liver and go to the next wave area.

## Define players start positions ## 
3 "Point" objects should be added into the root of **Object layers** named "players".
Only first 3 objects are used. The rest objects are ignored.
Their naming doesn't matter.

## Define next stage map file name ## 
Use menu **Map / Map Properties**/ to see the list of properties.
Expand "Custom Properties" group. Click "+" button at the bottom to
add "**nextmap**"(string) property.
If the property is not present then the default map name "stage1a_map" is used.
Do not add neither path nor extension to the to the map name.

There are predefined map names for special cases:
* **ending** <- End the game and show "ending" movie.     
* to be added     
 
## In-Game drawing order ##
The BG images are drawn starting from the very last item in the list back to the top.

10 -> 9 -> 8 ... -> 1

How to move image layers up/down
 * Use menu **Layer / Raise Layer / Lower Layer** 
 * Use buttons at the bottom of the layers window
 * Use **Ctrl+Shift+Up / Down** hot keys
## Controls ##
Use Ctrl + Up/Down to move current object/layer up/down withing the list.

Middle mouse key / Wheel to pan the whole level.

Ctrl + Wheel up/down to zoom in/out.

Hold Shift key on drawing an object to keep proportions.
